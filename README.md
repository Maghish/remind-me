# Remind Me

Remind is a simple task managing tool where you can create, edit and delete tasks as you desire. 

## What makes this application stand out from other task managing applications?

Thought this is a simple task management application, you can give "ranks" to tasks meaning tasks will be arranged in rank wise order. Lower the rank, the higher the importance. The ranks are basically in ascending order so rank #1 is always the highest priority and higher the rank goes meaning the lower the priority.
